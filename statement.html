  <b>First Paragraph</b><br>
  My favorite medium that I have worked with is Photoshop the reason why it is one of my favorite tools is because of how versatile it is. I have used it to create drawings, edit and warp photographs, and mish-mash images together. Another medium that I enjoy is traditional art, although I know it isn't a digital medium I tend to combine the two to create different kinds of artwork and enjoy drawing in my sketchbook(some examples of my sketches are posted below). The whole reason for my creating artwork is due to how I wish to show my interpretation of the world as well as the different kinds of things that I imagine in my head such as a different rendition of the world or just making something from my imagination and just sketching it out, overall I feel my goal in life is to continue my illustrative work.</b><br><br><br>
<b>Second Paragraph</b><br>
One project that I feel that demonstrates what I have previously stated is the project I had turned in for my final titled "Paper Menagerie". The reason that I feel this particular piece of work reflects me as an artist because it combines two of my favorite mediums when it comes to art, Photoshop and traditional media. This is one of my pinnacles for an art piece because of how I was able to convey what I am mostly about as I was able to showcase both my ability to use Photoshop as well as my endeavors when it came to traditional art.</b><br><br><br>
