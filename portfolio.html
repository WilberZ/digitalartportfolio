      <h3><i>Exqusite Cyborg</i>, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
      <p>This is a glitched image that was created in class. We created the intial png in groups we began with multiple images and began to put them all together to create a "cyborg". We than had to glitch the artwork through audacity or another medium if we could not get it to work. I used an online website in order to glitch this piece and I think this piece came out pretty interestingly as you can see the outline of the figure still.</p>

        <h3><i>Surreal Nature</i>, Digital Image, 2019</h3>
        <p> This is an image that was created in photoshop. I used a a forest-like area as the background and then found images of trash and debris online. The reason that I created this image to go off of the fact that we are becoming more and more aware of how our garabge and waste is affecting our environment.</p>

       <h3><i>Signal</i>, Howling, 1:00, 2019</h3>
       <p>This piece combines sounds that I had collected around school. I used the sound of knocking on a door, the rattling of fingers on glass, and the sound of the wind outside. I used these sounds to create a new type of sound that I feel kind of sounds spooky and faintly like howling and this would be ideally presented in a large and dark room.</p>

     <h3><i>Where am I?</i>, Digital Video, 1:21, 2019</h3>
     <p>This digital video uses recorded footage I filmed around school during nighttime. I used the interior of the art building, lights flashing outside and a lightpole in order to create a dark and atmospheric video. I did this to emulate found footage like horror movies as well as online webseries.</p>

     <h3><i>Horsehousing</i>, Interactive Net Art, 2019</h3>
     <p>This interactive net art piece is based on early internet memories. In order to achieve this effect, my partner and I created two rooms one for strange images that reminded us of old internet images and another room that reminded us of a old film reel playing an old video.</p>

     <h3><i>Paper Menagerie</i>, Composite Art using Photoshop, 2019</h3>
     <p>This is a composite art piece in which I used photoshop in order to create a series of image depicting animals. The way I had thought of this idea was through realizing what an interesting idea it would be to combine a paper drawings with real-life environments. I had decided to make animals my subject as well as nature in order to create a surreal image. I was pleased with the outcome as it had comeout how I had wanted.</p>
